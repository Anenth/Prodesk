title:  Important Standing Desk considerations

Are you inspired to take your office space to a higher level? Once you have taken the First step

## Start slow
Don’t try to go from usual hours of sitting to zero overnight. Aim
to sit just 3 of your working hours each day. So start with just 20 minutes at a time at your Standing Desk, then
add on time as you get used to the setup. Standing doesn’t sound like a lot of work, but when your body is used
to sitting most of the day, you will strain your body by standing too much, too fast.

## Use a mat
Take it easy on your knees, hips, and ankles by using a gel mat where
you plan to stand. Take it a step further and wear non-slip, supportive shoes, too.

## Get your work done
If standing is too distracting; use your sitting times when
you need that extra concentration. You may find the Standing Desk a little distracting at first, but you’ll likely
adjust and learn to refocus with time.

## Set it up right
Your computer screen should sit 15 to 30 inches from your eyes,
with your eye level even with (or slightly below) your screen. Keep your wrists flat and your elbows at a 90-degree
angle. If you feel like any part of your body is straining while you are standing then you need to make adjustments
to make it more comfortable.

## Move, too
Standing does burn more calories than sitting, but to really see optimal
health benefits make sure you are walking throughout the workday, too. Buy a pedometer or a fitness tracker and
add in steps where you see fit during the day. Look for creative ways to do other exercises during the workday,
too, that stretch your muscles and keep your circulation and metabolism going.

## Thinking about installing a Standing Desk for your own office space? 
Without a doubt,
standing tables have become the mark of a hip office. Any self-respecting startup that claims to hold employees'
well-being at the top of its priorities is hopping on this bandwagon. People across the country and even around
the world are taking a stand at work. The large companies are jumping in too — including AOL, Google, Twitter and
Facebook.

So, what are you waiting for? Stand up for yourself and experience the benefits…!
